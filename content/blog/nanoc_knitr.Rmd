The key to science is reproducibility: if others can't check your work, it might as well not exist.

This idea is evolving into a concept called [reproducible research](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata): don't just publish the results of an analysis, publish the analysis itself --- including the raw data and software.
This accelerates progress: not only is it easier to verify the results; it's easier to build on those results.

This applies to scientific _blogging_, too.
Blogs are already a fast way to spread ideas.
Blogs with data and software included --- "_reproducible_ blogs" --- are even faster, since others can grab the code and play with the concepts you present.
Not to mention, it's harder for mistakes to hide.

## Tips for reproducible blogging with knitr

I've set up this website to support reproducible blogging.
Here are some of the things I've learned along the way.

### Use a static site generator

Dynamic sites build the page every time it loads.
Static sites are nothing more than simple HTML files.
For reproducible blogging, static sites have the edge.

Re-running the R code every time the page loads would be too slow (and probably technically infeasible).
Instead, run the code locally on your computer, and just generate the HTML files once.
This is also much easier to host: no need for special software like PHP and MySQL; literally any webserver will do.

My weapon of choice is [nanoc], because it's flexible and extensible enough to handle whatever tools I want to use.
The downside (for me) is that it's written in Ruby, and I don't know Ruby.
But I'm glad I didn't let that stop me; in practice, it's been easy to pick up just what I need.

### Automatically link to the source for every page

True transparency doesn't make people hunt; it advertises!

Set up your site so the source link is automatic; otherwise, you're sure to forget a page.
My link is at the top right corner of every page; here's [how I made it](https://github.com/chiphogg/chogg_name/blob/3f8e2e1851bdf90282a9414b6843195fe7dd08a7/layouts/default.haml#L43-L45).

### Think of knitr as a text filter

In other words: a thing which gets some input text, and yields some output text.

Filters are nanoc's natural language.
Here's [the design for my initial knitr filter](https://github.com/chiphogg/chogg_name/blob/3f8e2e1851bdf90282a9414b6843195fe7dd08a7/lib/default.rb#L15-L25).
Its input is markdown with some R snippets; its output is the same markdown, but with the R snippets replaced by their results.
This output gets fed in turn into a "pandoc" filter, which turns that markdown into HTML.

(In fact, we'll soon see that knitr is a bit different if you want figures: it's better to think of it as a "filter _with side effects_".
More on that soon.)

### Don't be scared by git's lousy image handling

I procrastinated for more than a year between setting up knitr and getting figures to work.
The bogeyman was git's awful reputation for handling image files.
Over the years, people have developed [a confusing array of not-quite-satisfactory workarounds](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/540535/managing-large-binary-files-with-git), and I didn't want to go through the hassle of comparing them and committing to one.

Happily, git's handling of images turns out to be a complete non-issue, since _the images never end up in git_.
Only the source code goes in version control.
The output (including images) just gets copied to the webserver.

### Set `base.path` to the output directory for your post

I said earlier that knitr is a "filter with side effects".
Here's what I mean.

knitr runs whatever R code it finds and inserts the results in the text.
But sometimes, that R code does more than simply output an answer; for example, when you construct a plot, it creates an image file.
That's the "side effect".
And it raises a question: where should the image file be created?

Clearly, it needs to be created somewhere under the `output/` directory, or else it won't find its way to the webserver when we copy the files over.
If we want to keep things neat (and if we don't want to worry about filename collisions!), we should probably stick it in a subdirectory specific to its post.

Fortunately, knitr has an option called `base.dir` which controls where the figures end up.
Getting the figures right is as simple as setting this option to the appropriate directory for the current post.
Don't be confused by the similarly-named `root.dir` option!
For purposes of getting the figures to work, it's a complete red herring.

## An example!

```{r correlated_scatterplot, message=FALSE}
# Fix the seed for the random number generator (for reproducibility).
set.seed(1)

# Let's generate 200 pairs of random numbers.
N <- 200
random_numbers <- matrix(ncol=2, rnorm(n=2 * N))

# Generate a simple covariance matrix, and take its Cholesky decomposition so
# we can use it to generate correlated random draws.
covariance <- matrix(c(1, 0.9, 0.9, 1), nrow=2)
cholesky <- chol(covariance)
d <- data.frame(random_numbers %*% cholesky)
names(d) <- c('x', 'y')

# Make a simple scatterplot.
require(ggplot2)
print(ggplot(data=d, aes(x=x, y=y))
      + geom_point()
      + ggtitle("A pointless, point-filled plot")
      )
```

## Like it?  Do it.

I am far from the first to advocate and implement reproducible research in blogging.
For example, [Carl Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info/) has maintained an [open lab notebook](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html) for years; I'm sure there are many other examples which I haven't yet seen.

But I don't want it to be merely possible; I want it to be _commonplace_.
I want a world where technical bloggers who _don't_ share their data and software --- by default, on every post --- are regarded with suspicion.
Sharing this implementation --- showing one more way to do this --- takes us one small step closer to that world.
