# The main idea

[Gaussian Processes](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/) give us _probability distributions_ over **curves and surfaces**.
Unfortunately, these distributions can be hard to visualize.

One approach uses **animations**.  Here are the key ideas (my own contributions are in bold):

- Each _frame_ of the animation shows a curve/surface which is _drawn from the distribution_ we want to visualize.
- Consecutive frames show very _similar_ elements (so the animation is _continuous_).
- **Every frame has exactly the same statistical and kinematic properties (there are _no special "keyframes"_).**
- **The motion is smooth and natural (no "kicks").**

For example, here is an uncertain surface.  The datapoints have a gap in the middle.  The _entire_ surface is animated, but it moves more in the gap because the uncertainty is higher where datapoints are missing.

Remarkably, just a single ingredient is needed: the _"Gaussian oscillator"_.  This is a particle moving on a continuous path, whose position probability is the standard normal distribution at all times.  The right-hand side of the following figure shows independent Gaussian oscillators.  The left-hand side visualizes a distribution of curves.  Each frame is obtained by multiplying the vector of Gaussian oscillators by the lower-Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix (center).

My further contribution is to recognize that **Gaussian oscillators are also Gaussian processes**, but in the _time_ domain.  This places all future work on Gaussian animations into a familiar and well-studied framework.
